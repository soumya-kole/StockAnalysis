# What is Stock Correlation

Correlation is a statistical measure that indicates the extent to which two or more variables move in relation to each other. In the context of stocks, correlation can help us understand the degree to which the prices of two or more stocks move together. A positive correlation indicates that the stocks tend to move in the same direction, while a negative correlation means they move in opposite directions. By identifying uncorrelated stocks, traders can minimize risk and build a more balanced portfolio.
